# Repeat & Repeat interval
If you want specific `action` to repeat more than once you can provide `repeat` value. 
If you want to control the time between each repeat you can provide `repeat Interval` as well.

### Example

**Repeat Interval**
* `1`
* `1.5`
* `0.5`
* `2`
* `1e4` (Random value between 1 to 4)
* `empty` | `blank`
